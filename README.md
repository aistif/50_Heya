# 50_Heya

## Inspiration
هي pronounced as Heya, which means 'she'.
Yes she is powered by her own mind at her choice of field. She's Arabic women.
Any field she chose, definitely she will be extremely successful at it.

and, two of the numerous SHEs in the whole world have built this Art using AI project at AIArtathon :)

## What it does
The project transfers calligraphic artwork to a random image designed by our artist'. Then it applies that transferred calligraphy as a background of the chosen random image made by the artist.

## How we built it
We used colab throughout the building process. We used GAN for the style transfer process of the calligraphy artwork. Also we used computer vision technique to convert the background of an image transparent.

## Challenges we ran into
It is our first trial to use the AI with images, thus we had some difficulties and learning the techniques. Also, hardware capabilities been an issue along with the internet.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The piece of art that our code is generating at every run. The knowledge we made to collect during this short period of time.

## What we learned
- How to construct an art concept
- How to apply GANs and the style transfer methods
- How to apply some computer vision approaches to preprocess the image

## What's next for 50_Heya
The calligraphy used in this piece of art is general. As a next step we are planning to link the image of 'she' with the related work field calligraphies to her image.

Also, as longterm plan, we look forward to make this art generated from her selfie.


Thank you ^_^
